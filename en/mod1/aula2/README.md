# Lesson 2: What is an SDK?

## Introduction

Welcome to our second lesson! Today, we will introduce the concept of **SDK** (**Software Development Kit**), which is essential for developing and integrating Web2 and Web3 systems. An SDK is a collection of tools that provides everything developers need to create applications, making it easier to interact with APIs and other systems.

### Lesson Plan:

1. Definition of an SDK and API  
2. Package repositories: NPM, PyPi, and Crates  
3. Examples of SDKs in the Web3 context

## 1. Definition of an SDK and API  

### What is an SDK?

An **SDK** is a set of tools, libraries, code samples, and documentation that facilitates software development for a specific environment or technology. In the Web3 context, SDKs help developers interact with blockchain networks and smart contracts.

- **Example in Web3**: SDKs like Web3.js or Ethers.js provide ready-to-use methods and functions for operations like checking balances, sending transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.  

### What is an API?

An **API** (**Application Programming Interface**) allows different systems to communicate in a standardized way. It defines a set of rules that enables software to interact with another.

- An **SDK** is the complete set of tools and resources that simplifies implementation.  
- An **API** consists of the functions provided by the SDK, making service implementation easier or more efficient.

## 2. Package Repositories: NPM, PyPi, and Crates  

SDKs are often distributed via package repositories, allowing developers to integrate them directly into their projects.

### NPM (Node Package Manager)  

- **Usage**: For JavaScript/TypeScript projects.  
- **Example**: The **Web3.js** library is available on NPM, allowing developers to quickly install the package and start building Web3 applications.  

- [lunesjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunesjs)  
- [lunesrs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunesrs)  
- [lunesweb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunesweb)  

### PyPi (Python Package Index)  

- **Usage**: For Python projects.  
- **Example**: The **Web3.py** library is available on PyPi, enabling Python developers to interact efficiently with blockchain networks.  

- [merkly](https://pypi.org/project/merkly/)  
- [keccaky](https://pypi.org/project/keccaky/)  
- [lunespy](https://pypi.org/project/lunespy/)  

### Crates.io  

- **Usage**: For Rust projects.  
- **Example**: **ethers-rs** is a popular SDK for Web3 interactions in Rust, available on Crates.io. This SDK allows smart contract creation and blockchain interaction.  

- [calc_near_x](https://crates.io/crates/calc_near_x)  
- [merkletreers](https://crates.io/crates/merkletreers)  
- [ed25519-axolotl](https://crates.io/crates/ed25519-axolotl)  
- [lunes](https://crates.io/crates/lunes)  
- [lunesweb](https://crates.io/crates/lunesweb)  
- [lunesrs](https://crates.io/crates/lunesrs)  
- [lunes-cli](https://crates.io/crates/lunes-cli)  

These repositories make it easier to install and update libraries, ensuring that developers have access to stable and secure versions of the tools they use.

## 3. Examples of SDKs in the Web3 Context  

Let's explore some of the most commonly used SDKs for interacting with blockchain:

- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript SDK for Ethereum, enabling wallet creation, on-chain data queries, and smart contract transactions.  
- **Ethers.js**: An alternative to Web3.js with a modern, security-oriented approach for JavaScript/TypeScript developers.  
- **Web3.py**: A widely used Python SDK for Ethereum interactions, particularly in backend and analysis contexts.  
- **ethers-rs**: A Rust-based library for developers working with high-performance blockchain integrations.  

These SDKs are available through package repositories, allowing developers to choose the tool that best suits their programming language and project requirements.

## Conclusion  

Today, we learned what an **SDK** is and the difference between an SDK and an API. We also explored how major Web3 tools are distributed through package repositories like NPM, PyPi, and Crates.io, simplifying their integration into projects.

## Homework  

1. [Web3.js] Explore the official SDK documentation and familiarize yourself with its basic setup.

## Next Lesson  

In the next lesson, we will understand the role of **cryptography** in Web3 interactions, covering how to protect data and perform secure blockchain transactions. See you there!
